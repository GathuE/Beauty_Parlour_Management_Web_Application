    2. Developed an administrative panel for the business owner to evaluate income generated by each employee and service over specified periods.
    3. Included functionality for printing physical copies of income reports for future reference.
    4. Created a customer reward module that awards points based on the amount spent on services, allowing clients to redeem points for specific services.
